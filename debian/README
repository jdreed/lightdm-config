README for debathena-lightdm-config

debathena-lightdm-config ships a lightdm greeter called
debathena-lightdm-greeter in /usr/share/xgreeters.  If you choose to use
this greeter, or if you accepted all the default responses when
installing the package, no further action is required.  If you choose to
use an alternative greeter (e.g. unity-greeter), you'll need to
configure lightdm to allow manual logins, and you are encouraged to hide
the user list.  For more information, see
- /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm-set-defaults
- /usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.gz

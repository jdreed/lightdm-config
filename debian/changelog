debathena-lightdm-config (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scale the background, since most displays are not 2560x1600
  * Bump the scaling factor on the owl, the previous values were when we
    were in an additional window and could obscure the greeter
  * Disallow logins when we're taking an update
  * Explain how to type a username correctly
  * The show-message callback takes 3 args, not 2.
